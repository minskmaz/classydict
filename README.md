classydict
==========

A JavaScript HashTable inspired by Python's dictonary type and built in Classy

After tinkering with JavaScript for a few days I was saddened to realize there wasn't a
builtin dictionary type. After reading I ported (http://www.mojavelinux.com/articles/javascript_hashes.html "MohaveLinux") approach
and built classydict.
