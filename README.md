A JavaScript HashTable inspired by Python's dictonary type and built in Classy

After tinkering with JavaScript for a few days I was disappointed to find the language
doesn't contain a builtin dictionary type. After reading I ported the
[MohaveLinux](http://www.mojavelinux.com/articles/javascript_hashes.html "MohaveLinux") approach.
ClassyDict is built using (http://classy.pocoo.org/ "Classy") which "implements
Python inspired classes for JavaScript." 


[Classy](http://classy.pocoo.org/ "Classy") is awesome.
