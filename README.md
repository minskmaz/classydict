classydict
==========

A JavaScript HashTable inspired by Python's dictonary type and built in Classy

JavaScript doesn't provide a builtin dictionary type. I ported the
[MohaveLinux](http://www.mojavelinux.com/articles/javascript_hashes.html "MohaveLinux") approach.
ClassyDict is built using [Classy](http://classy.pocoo.org/ "Classy") which "implements
Python inspired classes for JavaScript." 


[Classy](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/classy "Classy") is super small lib for organizing functionality in your app into discrete classes just like you would in python.
